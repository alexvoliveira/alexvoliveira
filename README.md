## Alexandre V. O.

> Hello.

I started programming in **2019**, initially as a hobby, and over the years I have built a **solid foundation in Java**, which is currently my **primary and strongest language**. My focus is on writing **clear, maintainable, and well-structured code**, always aligned with established best practices and official documentation.

Although Java is my main area of expertise, I have experience with other **high-level languages** and continuously work on improving my **problem-solving skills**, algorithmic thinking, and software design fundamentals. I value **correctness, consistency, and long-term maintainability** over quick or fragile solutions.

I believe good developers are built on strong fundamentals. For that reason, I actively avoid superficial approaches, seek to understand problems in depth, and am always open to **learning, feedback, and collaboration**. I am comfortable asking questions when necessary and supporting others whenever possible.
